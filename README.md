### 🧭 About Me

<p align="justify">
I’m a passionate <strong>Front-End Web Developer</strong> currently learning through the <strong>ALX Software Engineering Program</strong>.  
My journey into tech began from a desire to <strong>create</strong> — to transform ideas into real, working solutions that inspire, connect, and serve people.  

I believe that creativity and technology are powerful gifts meant to make an impact.  
That’s why my long-term goal is to use my skills to build tools that empower communities and faith-based organizations.  
I’m especially inspired to <strong>serve the Church</strong> through meaningful, user-centered digital projects.
